# Operations & real business photos

Add your own photos here to replace placeholders. No code changes needed beyond updating image paths if you use different filenames.

## Suggested filenames (used by the site)

| File | Where it appears |
|------|------------------|
| `foundation.jpg` | About – Our Foundation (cotton yard / company background) |
| `warehouse.jpg` | About – Our Operations; Home – Glimpses |
| `cotton-yard.jpg` | About – Our Operations; Home – Glimpses |
| `container-loading.jpg` | About – Our Operations; Home – Glimpses |
| `office-team.jpg` | About – Our Operations; Home – Glimpses |

Until these files exist, the site shows a simple placeholder. Replace with real warehouse, cotton yard, container loading, and office/team photos for an authentic look.
